# Adrian Chavez-Loya  
**Data & Analytics Engineer**

I consider myself an analytics engineer because I thrive on connecting data engineering with analytics. I want to be involved in the entire data journey, from the initial source systems all the way to the final insights and dashboards that drive business decisions.

I enjoy building scalable data systems that transform raw, messy data into reliable, analytics ready datasets using ETL/ELT processes, data warehousing, and solid modeling practices.

I'm fascinated by how data moves through organizations and becomes actionable intelligence. I've become comfortable working with various tools and technologies including Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and PySpark. I'm always exploring new techniques and tools for different business needs, currently diving into DuckDB, Apache Airflow, and streaming technologies like Kafka and Flink.

This field constantly evolves and I'm committed to continuous learning, currently focusing on pipeline automation, data quality, and building cloud data stacks that make analytics seamless and decision making more effective.
