# Adrian Chavez-Loya  
**Data Engineer | Data Analyst | Lifelong Learner**

I’m a data engineer focused on bridging the gap between data engineering** and data analytics—building the systems that make high-quality insights possible downstream.  
My work centers on transforming raw, unstructured data into reliable, analytics-ready datasets through scalable pipelines, efficient transformations, and strong data modeling practices.

I’m passionate about understanding how every part of the data lifecycle connects—from ingestion and orchestration to modeling and visualization.  
Currently, I’m deepening my skills and learning how to automate transformations, implement data quality checks, and design end-to-end modern cloud data stacks that enable seamless analytics and decision-making.
