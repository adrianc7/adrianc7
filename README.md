# Adrian Chavez-Loya  
**Data Engineer | Data Analyst**

I'm a data engineer focused on bridging the gap between data engineering and analytics—building scalable systems that enable high-quality insights downstream. My work transforms raw, unstructured data into reliable, analytics-ready datasets through efficient pipelines, robust transformations, and strong data modeling practices.

I'm passionate about understanding the complete data lifecycle—from ingestion and orchestration to modeling and visualization. Through hands-on projects, I'm exposing myself to a diverse technology ecosystem while maintaining core expertise in Python and SQL for data processing, and Tableau/Power BI alongside Python visualization libraries for analytical storytelling.

Currently, I'm deepening my skills in pipeline automation, data quality implementation, and designing modern cloud data stacks that support seamless analytics and decision-making.
